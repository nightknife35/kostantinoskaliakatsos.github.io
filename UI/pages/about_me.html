                            <p>
                                Hello, I'm Kostas, a Digital Renaissance CP student currently pursuing my degree in Computer Engineering. Thriving on the aspect of new challenges and possessing a knack for adapting to various tech domains, my fascination lies at the intersection of multiple disciplines. From crafting sleek front-end interfaces to delving into the intricacies of backend systems and AI, I am always eager to tackle the next exciting challenge—whether it's training neural networks or designing responsive websites.

                            <h2>My Journey</h2>                   
                            <p>
                                My journey starts in my bed, listening to stories about black holes, physics, and math that left me with countless questions. Since I was never truly satisfied with my limited knowledge of how the world works, I took it upon myself to seek answers. I was a curious kid who loved taking apart electronics (and sometimes breaking them) to see how they worked, often tweaking them in the process. Today, I'm transforming that childhood curiosity into expertise and hope to better the world through my research, gadgets, and software.

                            <h2>My Philosophy</h2>                   
                            <p>
            
                                I believe in the ability to adapt and learn across disciplines. One must always be prepared to face challenges when they arise and to view problems through different lenses, especially in creative tasks. Asking "Why?" and "How?" are the first steps toward innovation.
                                I also believe in the idea that technology should be accessible to all.
                                I truly believe I can make a positive impact on the world, which is why my journey will never end. My dream is to spend my days turning my projects into reality and sharing them with the world. If you want to contribute to my dream, i invite you to reach out!
